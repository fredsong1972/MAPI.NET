## MAPI.NET

Messaging API (MAPI) provides the messaging architecture, a set of interfaces, functions, and other data types to facility the development of email messaging. Currently all MAPI wrapper components are unmanaged or dependant on unmanaged MAPI wrapper DLLs. That causes a lot of problems to deploy and support a 64-bit environment. MAPI.NET is a pure .NET Standard 2.0 component based on the MAPI common interface.

## Getting Started

The following examples demonstrate how to use the `MAPI.NET` in your application.

- Open default message store

    session = new MAPISession();
    session.Initialize();
    session.OpenMessageStore("");    
    ```

- Register events
    ```csharp
    session.MsgStore.RegisterEvents(EEventMask.fnevNewMail |
                                    EEventMask.fnevObjectCreated |
                                    EEventMask.fnevObjectCopied |
                                    EEventMask.fnevObjectDeleted |
                                    EEventMask.fnevObjectModified |
                                    EEventMask.fnevObjectMoved);
    ```
